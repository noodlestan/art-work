# Guide: Art Work

> Host and manage the Art Work orchestration tools and applications, and their planning artefacts.

Monorepo containing the Art Work orchestration tools and applications, and their planning artefacts.

Uses Workflow: Planning Work with one backlog per package, coordinating with Workflow: Roadmapping from one project-wide roadmap.

## Recommended Reading

Agents SHOULD scan these files for relevant clarifications when faced with ambiguity or omissions that may result from missing definitions.

- `_guide.md` — this file: system overview, layout, setup, verification.
- `_records/project.art` — the project record.
- `_records/repository.art` — the repository record.

## Repository Layout

```
_guide.md           — this file
_backlog/           — plans, instructions, reports
_records/           — project, repository, namespace, and license records
architecture/       — repository-level architecture documentation
cli/                — CLI packages
cli/work            — `@art-work/cli`
```

## Records Management

Records are co-located with the resources they describe in `_records/` directories:

- **Project:** `_records/project.art`
- **Repository:** `_records/repository.art`
- **Namespace:** `_records/namespace.art`
- **License:** `_records/license.art`

## Knowledge References

This repository maintains architecture references at:

- `architecture/index.md` — repository-level architecture index.
- `cli/work/architecture/index.md` — repository-level architecture index.

## Workflows

Projects in this repository use the following workflows:

| Workflow / Path                                                            | Purpose                                                                                           |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Planning Work** `$DOMAINS/work/workflows/planning-work/workflow.art`     | Create and manage work item lifecycles, collecting operational instructions according to context. |
| **Delegating Work** `$DOMAINS/work/workflows/delegating-work/workflow.art` | Organize work delegation to sub-agents with validation, execution, and verification.              |
| **Executing Work** `$DOMAINS/work/workflows/executing-work/workflow.art`   | Organize work execution by sub-agents to produce completed, verified outcomes and feedback.       |
| **Deploying** `$DOMAINS/deployments/workflows/deploying/workflow.art`      | Organizes deployment of artefacts in operations.                                                  |

### Roadmapping

- The roadmap lives at `_roadmap/` with subdirectories such as `/3-now` and `/4-next/`.
- The short-term roadmapping focus is captured in `_roadmap/_parking-lot.md`.
- The requirements, use cases, and principles are captured in `_roadmap/_architect.md`.

### Planning Work

- The backlog lives at `_backlog/` with subdirectories such as `/3-now` and `/4-next/`.
- The short-term focus is captured in `_backlog/_parking-lot.md`.
- Planning coordination and constraints are captured in `_backlog/_architect.md`.

## Operating Instructions

### Operating Instructions: Setting Up

**Instructions:**

Run from the repository root (monorepo):

```bash
npm ci # to install dependencies.
```

### Operating Instructions: Verifying Completion

**Instructions:**

Runs automatically on pre-commit hook (from the repository root):

```bash
npm run ci # lint, test and build
```
